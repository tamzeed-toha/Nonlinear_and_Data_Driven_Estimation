abstract = {Drones have gained popularity in a wide range of field ranging from aerial photography, aerial mapping, and investigation of electric power lines. Every drone that we know today is carrying out some kind of control algorithm at the low level in order to manoeuvre itself around. For the quadrotor to either control itself autonomously or to develop a high-level user interface for us to control it, we need to understand the basic mathematics behind how it functions. This paper aims to explain the mathematical modelling of the dynamics of a 3 Dimensional quadrotor. As it may seem like a trivial task, it plays a vital role in how we control the drone. Also, additional effort has been taken to explain the transformations of the drone's frame of reference to the inertial frame of reference.},

@ARTICLE{Kong_2019,title={An internal model approach to estimation of systems with arbitrary unknown inputs},year={2019},author={He Kong and He Kong and Salah Sukkarieh and Salah Sukkarieh},doi={10.1016/j.automatica.2019.06.034},pmid={null},pmcid={null},mag_id={2962255320},journal={Automatica},abstract={Abstract   Estimation of systems with arbitrary unknown inputs, for which no models or statistical properties are assumed to be known, has received much attention. Given that no prior knowledge is assumed for the unknown inputs, the estimator has to be designed to be dissociated from their effects, i.e., the problem at hand has also been called unknown input decoupled estimation. The most significant results in the literature, pioneered by Hautus and others, show that the strong       ∗      detectability requirements, namely, (1) a rank matching condition; (2) the system is minimum phase, are necessary and sufficient for stable estimation of the state/unknown input. Recent research has sought alternative methods, when the above conditions do not hold. However, existing results have only addressed a few specific scenarios. For the most general case with the unknown inputs affecting both the state dynamics and the output, the essential question of whether and under what conditions it is still possible to obtain instantaneous and asymptotically stable estimation of the full state, when the strong       ∗      detectability conditions do not hold, has remained open for a long time. Answering such a question is critical for real-time feedback control with closed-loop stability and offset free regulation/tracking performance guarantees. The current paper will fill this gap via an internal model approach. We make a crucial observation that albeit without any model or statistical properties for the unknown inputs, one does have a model for their sum over time (to illustrate, here we consider the discrete-time case), which is an integrator driven by the unknown inputs. By incorporating this model into the original system model to form an augmented system, we establish conditions under which the augmented system is strong       ∗      detectable so that a strong observer exists and can be constructed to estimate the augmented state variable, comprised of the original system state and the unknown input sum, with asymptotically stable error. Moreover, the former conditions prove to encompass well-known results in the existing literature on offset free tracking with known disturbance models as special cases. Hence, the proposed results generalize the classical internal model principle from the conventional case when models of the disturbances are assumed to be known to the case with arbitrary unknown disturbances.}}

Data are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized systems and systems that are time-varying or have external forcing.}}
